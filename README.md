# **Botan(apple) Gardening**
How often should I water my plant? Where is it native to?

Botan(apple) Gardening is a program that helps people learn about and care for the plants in their day-to-day life! Botan(apple) can find information about almost any plant and displays it on an easy-to-read, colorful page for the conveience of my fellow plant lovers.

## **How it Works**
Botan(apple) relies on an API to search for information on household, wild, and event extinct plants. It is then able to filter through the information, returning only the information users request for their specific needs.
